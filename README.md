My smart home

This will be my personal project using raspberry pi 4 to implement my smart home. Super excited!

My first step: implement the temperature and humidity monitoring with hdt 22
Second step: implement the PM2.5 monitering.


Here is a very initial demo for of my DHT22 sensor UI.

Add a Calendar component into my UI. It can synchronize with your google calendar
